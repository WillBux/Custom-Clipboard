# Custom-Clipboard
This is a filing system for copying and pasting.  
  
This program turns your function keys into copy and paste keys. F1 is copy for bucket 1 and F2 pastes bucket 1. F3 is copy for bucket 2 and F4 pastes bucket 2. This pattern continues until F12. 
  
To run this program you must use sudo: 
``` sudo python Clipboard.py ```
